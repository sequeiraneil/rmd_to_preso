# Alignment

The `class` slide property lets you assign CSS classes to slides, and remark comes with a set of classes for setting **horizontal and vertical text alignments**

`class: middle, center`

center vertically and horizontally, as seen in the next slide

---
class: middle, center

# Alignment

The alternatives available for vertical alignment: 

- top
- middle
- bottom

(and I don't like how the bullets are left aligned)


---
class: right

# Horizontal Alignment
The classes available for horizontal alignment:

- left
- center
- right

(again, the bullets are aligned on the left)


---

# Content Classes

WTF is that? 

Content classes let you assign CSS classes to a text block, and remark comes with a set of classes for setting horizontal text alignment

For example below, the text block of 3 bullet points is nested inside a `.pull-right[]` content class

.pull-right[
- point 1
- point 2
- point 3
]

# Images

Regular images are inserted using normal Markdown image syntax, and are treated like regular content that can be placed inside content classes, e.g. to be aligned:


- An exclamation mark: !;
- followed by a set of square brackets, containing the alt attribute text for the image;
- followed by a set of parentheses, containing the URL or path to the image, and an optional title attribute enclosed in double or single quotes.

# Background Images

The `background-image` slide property lets you set the background-image CSS property for the slide.

The background image will by default be centered both horizontally and vertically on the slide, and scaled down to fit if it is larger than the slide.

# Video

There are multiple ways to include embedded video within a Remark presentation. Embed code from YouTube or others sites work as is:

`class: middle, center`
