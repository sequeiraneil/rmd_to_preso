# Alignment

The `class` slide property lets you assign CSS classes to slides, and remark comes with a set of classes for setting **horizontal and vertical text alignments**

`class: middle, center`

center vertically and horizontally, as seen in the next slide

---
class: middle, center

# Alignment

The alternatives available for vertical alignment: 

- top
- middle
- bottom

(and I don't like how the bullets are aligned)


---
class: right

# Horizontal Alignment
The classes available for horizontal alignment:

- left
- center
- right

(again, the way bullets are aligned is annoying me)


---

# Content Classes

WTF is that? 

Content classes let you assign CSS classes to a text block, and remark comes with a set of classes for setting horizontal text alignment

For example below, the text block of 3 bullet points is nested inside a `.pull-left[]` and `.pull-right[]` content class. Must be done in that order!

.pull-left[
- point 4

- Not exactly what I was thinking but useful alignment, particularly if the sentences are really long

- point 6
]


.pull-right[

1. point 1

1. point 2

1. point 3

]

# Images

Regular images are inserted using normal Markdown image syntax, and are treated like regular content that can be placed inside content classes, e.g. to be aligned:


- An exclamation mark: !;
- followed by a set of square brackets, containing the alt attribute text for the image;
- followed by a set of parentheses, containing the URL or path to the image, and an optional title attribute enclosed in double or single quotes.

![This image](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/img15/pet-products/small-tiles/23695_pets_vertical_store_dogs_small_tile_8._CB312176604_.jpg)

# Background Images

The `background-image` slide property lets you set the background-image CSS property for the slide.

The background image will by default be centered both horizontally and vertically on the slide, and scaled down to fit if it is larger than the slide.


---
class: middle, center

# Video

There are multiple ways to include embedded video within a Remark presentation. Embed code from YouTube or others sites work as is:

`class: middle, center`

# Slide Basics

## Slide Separators

A line containing three dashes, represents a slide separator
`---`

## Slide Incrementors

.pull-left[A line containing two dashes allows avoiding having to duplicate content if a slide is going to add to the previous one. (inherits content of the previous slide)

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Slide

- bullet 1
--

- bullet 2
```
]

.pull-right[Empty lines before and after the two dashes are of significance as the preceding newline character is omitted to enable adding to the last line of the previous slide. Thus, as the extra bullet point in the above example needs to go on a separate line, an extra line is added after the two dashes to force a newline. Without the extra line, the resulting text would have been - bullet 1- bullet 2.]

---

# Slide Notes

A line containing 3 question marks (???) represents a separator of content from notes on the slide

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Slide

Some content

???
Some note
```

A notes open version of a slide show can be shared by sharing the url with #p1 appended. Such as remarkjs.com/#p1.

With Incremental Slides the notes go after each increment

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Hello

???
# notes for hello

--
# World

???
notes for world
```

---

# Comments

To leave a comment in the markdown but not render in the slides, two options available:

1. HTML, visible in page source
```{r eval = FALSE}
<!-- 
    This is a comment.
-->
```

1. Empty Link
```{r eval = FALSE}
[//]: #(This is a comment too)

```

# Slide Properties

Initial lines of a slide on a key-value format will be extracted as slide properties.

## `name` property

The `name` property accepts a name to be used to identify the current slide

`name: agenda`

Two simple uses 

a. is to link to a slide using a URL fragment `slideshow.html#agenda`

b. Reference slide  when using the `template` slide property

---

# `Class` property

The class property accepts a comma-separated list of class names, which are applied to the current slide

```{r eval=FALSE}
class: center, middle

# Slide with content centered in both dimensions
```

Built-in slide classes include `left`, `center`, `right`, `top`, `middle` and `bottom`, which may be used to align entire slides.

---

# `background-image` property

The `background-image` property maps directly to the background-image CSS property, which are applied to the current slide:

```{r eval=FALSE}
background-image: url(image.jpg)

# Slide with background image
```

Other slide background CSS properties defined in the default remark styles:

```{r eval=FALSE}
background-position: center;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-size: contain;      
/* applied using JavaScript only if background-image is larger than slide */
```

---

# `count` property

The count property allows for specific slides **NOT** to be included in the slide count, which is by default displayed in the lower right corner of the slideshow:

```{r eval=FALSE}
count: false

This slide will not be counted
```


When the `countIncrementalSlides` configuration option is enabled, all incremental slides will automatically have the `count: false` slide property set.
