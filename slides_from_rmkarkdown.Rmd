## Begin with Why \| aka Why Am I Learning this? {.build}

> I write everyday in various text editors - Wordpress for my blog, a physical book for my journal, VSCode or RStudio for code.

> Communicating requires both **writing**, and **presenting**, which I have to do often.

> Is there a way of combining my writing and presentation into a single document that serves both purposes?

> Rmarkdown apparently offers such a solution, so I'm going to invest an hour understanding it's out-of-the box capabilities.

## How am I learning this? \| aka Resources for learning

I often watch hours of YouTube videos and then get distracted. For this exercise though I'm documenting how I'm going about it as I do it.

Hyphens create a bulleted list, very handy

-   YiHui online book 'bookdown' <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html>
-   read it
-   use it here.

## First few features

-   bulleted lists
-   `##`creates the headline
-   `|` creates a sub-heading
-   YAML header allows customisations (adding `incremental: true`), watch the indentations
-   adding `>` before `-` allows building incrementally on some slides and not on others!

## More Features {.smaller}

> -   YAML `smaller: true` makes all text smaller
>
> -   \`{.smaller} is more targeted, like on this slide title
>
> -   `transition:` options are "default", "slower", "faster" or numeric in seconds 0.5

## Slide Build \| transitions

> -   <div>
>
>     > Slides can have a `{.build}` attribute that indicates their content should be displayed incrementally.
>
>     </div>
>
>     <div>
>
>         Slide Build {.build}
>
>     </div>
>
> -   Slide attributes can be combined if you need to specify more than one
>
>         Slide Build {.build .smaller}
